# Scholion 🦝✨

**A private, local-first workspace for recorded evidence.**

Scholion turns audio and video into reproducible canonical transcripts, preserves source and processing provenance, lets people search a private corpus and navigate results back to exact verified evidence, and keeps notes, tags, collections, speaker labels, and saved research questions as durable user-owned knowledge.

Transcription is the engine room, not the whole product. Scholion also inspects the machine, chooses a safe local execution strategy, manages model custody, survives interrupted work, keeps word-level timing and anonymous-speaker evidence, publishes portable transcript views, incrementally reconciles an evolving library, plays verified local source evidence, and gives deletion the same explicit custody rules as creation.

Canonical transcript JSON is authoritative transcript evidence. Human-authored research state is authoritative user knowledge. DuckDB search/research projections and publication formats are rebuildable. The original recording is read-only throughout normal processing and can only be deleted through a separate explicit provenance-checked operation.

> **Scholion's product rule:** do complicated work locally, keep the evidence understandable, portable, and owned by the user.

## Why Scholion?

A *scholion* is an explanatory, critical, or interpretive note attached to a text; the plural is *scholia*. The name matches the product's evidence model: the recording and canonical transcript remain the source evidence, while human notes, labels, collections, and saved research questions accumulate around verified passages without replacing the source. See **[Product identity](docs/product-identity.md)** for the canonical naming contract.

Start with **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** for human-facing documentation or **[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md)** for the shortest clone-to-transcript path. The desktop also keeps contextual help available inside the app so ordinary use does not depend on having repository docs open.

## What can it do right now?

Scholion is pre-production, but the backend and desktop cover a coherent path from importing a recording through local processing, evidence search, durable research, transcript/speaker management, verified local playback, and custody-aware storage management.

| Area | Current foundation |
|---|---|
| Local transcription | faster-whisper CPU/int8 and CUDA-capable strategies with explicit managed model revisions |
| Hardware awareness | process-visible CPU/RAM, affinity/cgroup limits, accelerator topology, engine capability negotiation, resource admission |
| Media handling | FFprobe inspection, explicit embedded-audio-track confirmation for multi-track files, deterministic exact-stream FFmpeg canonicalization, exact source-relative work windows |
| Reliability | private checkpoints, validated resume, contiguous checkpoint ordering, bounded accelerated prefetch |
| Languages | multilingual decoding plus conservative local text-language attribution |
| Speakers | optional anonymous recording-scoped diarization, word-level handoffs, generation-bound display labels, honest overlap/mixed presentation |
| Difficult audio | optional deterministic FFmpeg noise suppression with provenance/timeline checks |
| Model custody | explicit inventory, recommendation, install, local revalidation, immutable revision pinning/removal; stronger project-owned policy trust is being integrated under #110 |
| Transcript output | canonical JSON plus deterministic TXT, SRT, WebVTT publication views |
| Search | private BM25 lexical retrieval, optional semantic retrieval, hybrid reciprocal-rank fusion |
| Evidence navigation | canonical-hash verification, aligned highlights, bounded context, speaker presentation, source seek coordinates |
| Verified playback | exact-generation/source re-verification, opaque Tauri media sessions, bounded native range streaming, current/older evidence coordinates; multi-track sources currently fail closed for playback |
| Research workspace | authoritative SQLite notes/tags/collections, rebuildable DuckDB projection, desktop browse/create/edit/delete/filter/anchor maintenance |
| Unified discovery | grouped transcript/note/tag/collection query without fabricated cross-type scores |
| Saved searches | durable typed query intent that re-resolves current evidence instead of freezing result snapshots |
| Safe lifecycle | typed plan-bound deletion scopes plus private execution-state retention, now exposed through a native Storage workspace with plan review, source second guard, and resume-loss warnings |
| Incremental library | cheap refresh/reconciliation plus durable transcript and recording locations |
| Processing Center | readiness, machine/model state, preflight, explicit multi-track stream confirmation, supervised start/cancel, resume versus retry, job-state discard, diarization/enhancement/publication intent |
| Transcript tools | generation-bound transcript/provenance inspection, speaker naming/removal, overlap-aware transcript view, post-hoc TXT/SRT/VTT publication |
| Desktop guidance | persistent screen/overview help plus contextual Evidence, Playback, Transcript, multi-track preflight, and Storage explanations without duplicating backend policy |
| Desktop presentation | Tauri + React Intake, Processing, Library, verified evidence reader/playback, Research, Storage, transcript tools, and eight semantic-token themes |
| Accessibility | keyboard/semantic-role tests, axe, non-hover contextual help, explicit light/dark browser schemes, and an eight-skin contrast matrix |
| Architecture hygiene | architecture/redundancy audit complete: shared capability-blind transport, centralized application composition, one typed saved-question surface, one Research evidence presentation contract |
| Quality | Linux/macOS/Windows CI, strict typing, lint/format/security, complexity/dead-code, branch coverage, dependency audit, Playwright/axe, native Rust tests, package verification, targeted mutation qualification |

Model trust has two deliberately separate levels today. Scholion already manages the local model receipt, immutable provider revision, cache containment, and expected local structure. The #110 supply-chain work adds a stronger project-owned policy that approves the exact upstream revision and full file set by size/SHA-256 before calling a model policy-trusted. See **[Signed update and model trust channel](docs/security/update-model-trust.md)**.

![Scholion recording-to-evidence static diagram](docs/diagrams/recording-to-evidence.svg)

</details>

Text fallback: source media is inspected and transcribed locally into canonical JSON; rebuildable search finds passages; canonical verification turns results back into evidence; durable human research attaches to that evidence; custody planning keeps destructive work explicit.

Search ranking is not source truth. A result points back to canonical transcript coordinates, and navigation verifies that generation before presenting precise evidence or accepting a durable note anchor.

## Desktop status

The Tauri + React desktop currently provides:

- native file/folder selection and remembered-location permissions;
- recording discovery without automatic processing side effects;
- a Processing Center for readiness, model state, job state, preflight, explicit embedded-audio-track confirmation, launch, cancel, resume/retry distinction, and private-state discard;
- Library search across transcripts, notes, tags, and collections;
- verified evidence context and source-relative cursor coordinates;
- generation/source-verified local audio/video playback from that evidence cursor without exposing source paths to React;
- Research note create/edit/delete, tag/collection navigation, saved-search lifecycle, typed retrieval controls, exact-generation evidence return, and explicit anchor review;
- transcript details/provenance, generation-safe speaker-name management, explicit speaker-overlap presentation, and post-hoc derived publication;
- a Storage workspace for backend-planned transcript custody changes, explicit source protection, and previewed old-processing cleanup;
- persistent **How this screen works** and **How Scholion works** guidance plus local Evidence/Playback/Transcript/multi-track/Storage explanations;
- eight accessible presentation skins through one compact theme picker; and
- persisted presentation preference without mixing theme state into evidence or research.

The browser/webview does **not** receive canonical/source filesystem paths for evidence navigation, transcript tools, playback, or lifecycle plans. Rust owns native desktop capability and opened media sessions; Python owns application/evidence/custody/media-selection rules; React owns presentation and explicit user intent.

When a file contains several embedded audio streams, Python reports that explicit confirmation is required. The desktop shows bounded source-declared title/language/default metadata when available, accepts the user's stream choice, and sends only that exact index back to Python for a fresh preflight. Start remains disabled until the backend returns a plan bound to that stream. Canonical provenance records the exact stream index and resume restores it. See **[Audio tracks](docs/audio-tracks.md)**.

Transcript tools are generation-bound. A long-lived UI cannot silently rename a speaker in a newer transcript generation: every inspect/mutation/publication request carries the exact canonical SHA-256 the user opened, and Python rejects stale identity. See **[Transcript and speaker tools](docs/transcript-tools.md)**.

Playback follows the same evidence discipline. Python re-verifies the exact canonical generation, original source bytes, bounded coordinate, and audio-stream identity; Rust then turns the approved source into an opaque local media session. Multi-track transcription is supported, but multi-track playback currently fails closed because the system WebView cannot yet prove it rendered the same embedded stream that produced the transcript. See **[Verified native playback](docs/native-playback.md)**.

Storage follows the same authority split. React requests a plan and renders the backend's effective scopes/actions; a separate fixed Tauri command can invoke only the custody bridge; Python recalculates the plan at execution and refuses stale confirmation tokens. Source and canonical paths are stripped before the response reaches React. See **[Storage and lifecycle controls](docs/storage-lifecycle.md)**.

In-app guidance is deliberately re-openable and non-hover-only where popovers are used, with inline help for required multi-track selection and storage/custody review. It explains those contracts where users encounter them but carries no filesystem/database/process authority and does not recreate application policy in React. See **[In-app guidance](docs/in-app-guidance.md)**.

There are still no end-user installers or Releases. The supported path remains a source build while packaging and first-run behavior are qualified.

## Themes and accessibility

Scholion ships **Archive, Midnight, Paper, Moss, Plum, Ember, Pride, and Monochrome**. They are not eight independent CSS systems. Every skin supplies the same semantic roles for background, surfaces, text, borders, accent/on-accent, controls, focus, errors, and selection.

Pride adds a decorative rainbow edge while leaving status meaning in text/structure. Monochrome is intentionally grayscale rather than another tinted dark theme. Every registered skin declares its native browser `color-scheme` and automatically enters the same Playwright WCAG-oriented contrast matrix and axe qualification.

Read **[Desktop themes and accessibility](docs/development/desktop-accessibility.md)** for the contract.

## Install the current source build

The supported development/source path uses Python 3.12 and Scholion's repository-local bootstrap. A system-wide `uv` installation is not required:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSD1805/Scholion.git
cd Scholion
python3.12 scripts/bootstrap_python.py
source .venv/bin/activate
scholion init
scholion doctor
```

On Windows, use `py -3.12 scripts\bootstrap_python.py`; activation is optional if you invoke `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` explicitly. See **[Project-local developer toolchain](docs/development/project-local-toolchain.md)** for the complete cross-platform contract and **[Desktop development prerequisites](docs/development/desktop-development.md)** for the native desktop.

## Plan, transcribe, and resume from the CLI

```bash
scholion models recommend
scholion models install small
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --dry-run
scholion transcribe interview.m4a
```

For a source with several embedded audio tracks, bind the exact FFmpeg stream index:

```bash
scholion transcribe meeting.mkv --audio-stream 3 --dry-run
scholion transcribe meeting.mkv --audio-stream 3
```

Add derived publication formats when useful:

```bash
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --export txt --export srt --export vtt
```

Resume a validated interrupted job:

```bash
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --resume JOB_ID
```

Model acquisition is explicit and network-bearing. Resume rechecks source identity and current resource admission rather than silently changing the execution contract, including its selected audio stream.

## Search, annotate, and name speakers

```bash
scholion library rebuild
scholion library search "housing insecurity"
scholion library find "housing insecurity" --context-segments 1
scholion library speakers list JOB_ID
scholion library speakers name JOB_ID speaker-02 "Dr. Chen"
scholion library speakers transcript JOB_ID
```

Speaker names are durable user-authored state. `speaker-02` remains anonymous machine-produced evidence; the human label is separate and generation-bound.

Research metadata can constrain retrieval, and saved searches persist the question rather than today's result snapshot. See **[Research search](docs/research-search.md)** and **[Research notes](docs/research-notes.md)**.

## Delete exactly what you mean

Deletion remains dry-run first from the CLI:

```bash
scholion library delete JOB_ID --scope library-view
```

The plan prints actions and a confirmation token. Nothing changes until the same request is repeated with that token. `canonical-transcript` does **not** imply `research-notes`, `saved-searches`, or `source-recording`.

The native desktop exposes the same contract under **Storage**: select explicit scopes, preview the backend-calculated plan, review any scope expansion/preservation consequences, then apply that exact plan. Source recording removal requires an additional acknowledgment and provenance check.

Age-based retention is narrower:

```bash
scholion library retention --execution-days 30
```

The Storage workspace can preview the same private-state cleanup and marks interrupted/failed candidates whose resume capability would be lost. Retention preserves canonical transcripts, human research, source media, and lightweight lifecycle manifests.

Read **[Storage and lifecycle controls](docs/storage-lifecycle.md)** and **[Safe deletion and retention](docs/architecture/safe-deletion-retention.md)** for the exact contract.

## Where the project goes next

Research/search, Processing, explicit embedded-track transcription, desktop comprehension/themes, transcript/speaker tools, verified native playback, contextual guidance, desktop lifecycle/retention controls, architecture/redundancy consolidation, and the Scholion identity migration are complete first-release foundation. The next first-release sequence is:

1. finish the #110 signed-update and policy-trusted-model integration, then package first-run storage setup, updates, and evidence-safe uninstall; public Linux packaging remains blocked by #135 until the supported Tauri stack leaves the affected GTK3/GLib graph;
2. backup/restore plus selected research portability;
3. packaged semantic-model/dependency custody; and
4. representative-device qualification across ordinary consumer hardware and hostile path, disk, interruption, upgrade, and accessibility cases, including the remaining #114 native CPU-only/accelerator task-transport evidence.

Freeform research notebook pages are a useful later research-native feature, but they are intentionally separate from evidence-anchored notes and are not on the first-release critical path.

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the capability audit and sequencing.
