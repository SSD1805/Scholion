# Durable research state architecture

Status: authoritative notes/tags/collections, saved searches, projection sync/rebuild,
research-aware retrieval, unified discovery, desktop note CRUD/labels, first-class label
navigation, exact-generation note → evidence return, saved-search lifecycle, and explicit
stale/unavailable-anchor review plus provenance-preserving re-anchoring are implemented.

Scholion keeps **user-authored research knowledge durable** while still making that
knowledge fast enough to use as part of corpus search.

The design deliberately uses two stores with different authority:

- **SQLite is authoritative user state.** Notes, tags, collections, evidence anchors,
  superseded anchor history, and saved-search intent live there because they are unique
  work the user cannot reconstruct from the transcript.
- **DuckDB is a rebuildable research projection.** It carries only relationships and
  lexical terms needed to query that user state efficiently alongside transcript search.

The databases do not share a transaction and do not attach to one another. Scholion
coordinates them through stable evidence identities and a deterministic projector.

Text fallback: canonical evidence creates a verified anchor; user research commits to
SQLite with a monotonic journal; a deterministic projector builds disposable DuckDB query
state; saved searches remain SQLite-authored intent; CLI, unified discovery, and the
desktop Research workspace consume the same application service boundary.

## Why two stores?

One database could technically hold everything. That would make the custody boundary
worse.

| Store | Authority | Contains | Rebuildable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQLite research state | authoritative | notes, current + superseded evidence anchors, tags, collections, saved searches, relationships, outbox sequence | **No** |
| DuckDB research projection | derived | evidence keys, note IDs, tag/collection IDs, lexical note terms, projection watermark | Yes |
| DuckDB lexical index | derived | transcript terms and segment metadata | Yes |
| DuckDB semantic index | derived | semantic chunks, segment map, numeric vectors | Yes |

SQLite fits the authoritative research workspace because the workload is transactional and
mutation-heavy. DuckDB fits analytical work such as scanning many segments, joining
relationships, restricting semantic candidates, and ranking results.

Making both authoritative would create a dual-master problem. Scholion avoids that class of
conflict:

```text
SQLite authority
      |
      | monotonic change journal
      v
Deterministic projector
      |
      v
DuckDB projection
```

If the stores disagree, SQLite wins.

## Evidence identity is the join contract

Research state never joins transcript evidence by a friendly segment ID alone.

The load-bearing projected evidence key is:

```text
(document_id, canonical_sha256, segment_id)
```

The full durable anchor also carries source identity, canonical path custody, optional
source path custody, and source-relative time coordinates. Including canonical SHA-256
prevents an annotation from silently attaching to a new transcript generation that reuses
`segment-000042`.

## Verified anchors, creation, and exact-generation return

`EvidenceAnchor` is produced only after canonical evidence validation. Before creating
durable research anchored to a transcript, the application verifies that the document is
present, canonical bytes still match the indexed SHA-256, requested segments exist in
canonical order, multi-segment selections are contiguous, and optional sub-segment
coordinates stay inside the verified span.

The desktop Evidence reader uses that same canonical segment/word/time system. Its narrow
create-note bridge carries the expected canonical SHA-256 and refuses the write if the
library has moved to a newer generation before Save. React never invents an annotation
identity or receives a raw canonical/source path.

Existing anchors reopen through `EvidenceLocator.locate_anchor()` and
`ResearchWorkspaceService.open_note_evidence()`. That read path verifies the **stored**
canonical bytes and source/document identities, validates stored segments and timing,
expands canonical context, and resolves speaker display labels against the stored
canonical generation.

The current transcript index is not used to substitute a newer generation. An older anchor
either opens against its exact valid stored evidence or fails closed. Exact-generation
return remains a read path, not an implicit migration path.

## Explicit anchor review and deliberate re-anchoring

`ResearchAnchorReviewService` adds a separate maintenance path without weakening exact
return. Review first attempts to reopen the stored anchor and classifies it as:

- `current_verified`;
- `older_verified`; or
- `unavailable`.

`older_verified` is not an error state. The user may keep that historical anchor forever.

For a non-current note the service may prepare a **candidate** from the current canonical
generation, but only when current evidence has the same `document_id` and the same
`source_sha256`. Candidate segments are derived from the old anchor's source-relative time
span, loaded from the current canonical transcript, then passed back through the existing
`EvidenceLocator` verifier. Similar-looking text in another recording is never considered a
repair candidate.

Candidate review does not mutate research state. Confirmation sends the authoritative
note `updated_at` plus the reviewed candidate canonical SHA-256. The service recomputes the
candidate server-side. If either the note or current generation changed, confirmation
fails and the user must review again.

The actual write is owned by `SqliteResearchAnchorStateStore`, a narrow adapter over the
**same** `research.sqlite3` authority. It uses one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction to:

1. copy the previous anchor and ordered segment IDs into `note_anchor_history` and
   `note_anchor_history_segments`;
2. replace the note's current anchor columns and segment relationships;
3. advance the existing monotonic research journal exactly once; and
4. commit all state together.

The history extension has its own schema-version metadata so additive anchor-history
storage can evolve without pretending the entire research schema was recreated. A note
deletion cascades through its superseded anchor history because that history exists only to
preserve the provenance of the durable note.

Re-anchoring cannot change `document_id` or `source_sha256`. This operation repairs a
note's current pointer within one recorded evidence lineage. It is not a general relinking
or cross-recording migration facility.

DuckDB never stores superseded anchor history as authority. Once the current note anchor
changes, the normal research journal causes the disposable projection to replace that
note's current evidence relationships. Historical anchors remain SQLite-only durable
provenance.

## Mutation, concurrency, and the journal

The authoritative note write path uses foreign keys, WAL mode, `synchronous=FULL`,
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` writer serialization, and one transaction for the user mutation **and**
its change-journal record.

Desktop note editing replaces body, tag relationships, and collection relationships in one
SQLite transaction and advances the journal once. The `EvidenceAnchor` columns and segment
relationships are not part of a normal prose/label update.

Desktop note edit/delete and deliberate re-anchor carry the `updated_at` value they read.
The stores check that version after `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` has acquired the writer boundary. A
mismatch fails closed, so a CLI edit or another local surface cannot be silently
overwritten by stale React state.

Saved-search rename/delete uses the same local concurrency principle. The workspace
metadata store checks optional `expected_updated_at` after its `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` boundary.
Desktop callers always provide that version. Existing CLI/application callers may omit it
where they deliberately operate as the immediate local authority.

Every projected note mutation advances a monotonic sequence. The projector consumes changes
in bounded batches and replaces touched notes from current authoritative state. Replay is
idempotent. The DuckDB watermark advances in the **same DuckDB transaction** as projected
rows.

Saved searches are authoritative SQLite state but are not part of the note relationship
projection, so their metadata mutation does not fabricate a research-journal event that no
projector consumes.

If retained journal history bridges a stale projection, replay it. If the projection is
missing, damaged, or too far behind, rebuild from a consistent SQLite snapshot. If DuckDB
claims to be ahead of SQLite authority, fail closed.

No unique user data is reconstructed from DuckDB.

## Research filters are pre-ranking constraints

Research metadata is not merely decoration when used as a filter. A query such as:

```text
transcript text = "housing affordability"
tag = methodology
collection = Chapter 3
```

first resolves research constraints to a canonical evidence scope. Lexical BM25 or
semantic retrieval then ranks **inside that scope**.

`evidence_scope = None` means unrestricted by research state. `evidence_scope = ()` means
the research restriction matched no evidence and search must return nothing.

Tags and collections are also first-class desktop navigation affordances. Multiple selected
labels preserve the backend's existing AND semantics; React does not reimplement filtering
over a capped overview snapshot.

## Saved searches are authored intent

Saved searches live in authoritative SQLite because a named reusable question is
human-authored workspace state. They persist typed search/research/retrieval intent, not a
derived evidence scope or snapshot of current results. Running one later re-resolves the
current corpus and research relationships.

Desktop creation sends name/query/optional description through a narrow bridge method.
Python constructs the typed `SearchQuery` and owns desktop defaults. Rename changes display
metadata while preserving the typed `SavedSearchIntent` server-side. Run re-enters the same
`ResearchWorkspaceService.search()` path used by current research-aware retrieval.

Frequent/recent tag or collection navigation is different. Those rankings are derived
convenience views and remain disposable.

## Workspace, desktop, and logging boundaries

`ResearchWorkspaceService` composes verified anchors, authoritative SQLite research state,
deterministic projection convergence, DuckDB research filtering/summaries, transcript
retrieval, grouped discovery, exact-generation research return, and saved-search behavior.
`ResearchAnchorReviewService` is a deliberately narrow companion for evidence maintenance.

The CLI and desktop bridge delegate to application services. Desktop methods are narrow DTO
operations: overview, filtered notes, verified note creation, atomic note replacement,
guarded note deletion, exact note-evidence opening, saved-search lifecycle, anchor review,
and confirmed re-anchor. React does not issue SQL, open SQLite/DuckDB, choose canonical
paths, derive repair candidates, or receive raw canonical/source filesystem paths.

Anchor-review DTOs expose evidence text, canonical SHA, segment IDs, and numeric coordinates
needed for inspection. They deliberately omit raw source/canonical paths and source SHA.
The backend retains those custody details and uses them during verification.

Research application operations emit structured events through the existing `ILogger`
boundary. Operational logs carry stable event names plus IDs, canonical SHA where evidence
identity matters, retrieval mode, counts, current/older state, and exception type on
failure. They deliberately omit note bodies, query text, saved-search names/descriptions,
and raw filesystem paths. Logging must not become a shadow research archive.

## Current deliberate limits

Research state currently does not provide:

- advanced typed desktop search controls for phrase/ANY/ALL, speaker, language, transcript,
  research filters, retrieval mode, and sort;
- rich-text/WYSIWYG note bodies;
- semantic embeddings over note prose;
- automatic cross-generation re-anchoring;
- cross-recording re-anchoring;
- collaborative synchronization; or
- selected/citable result-set objects.

## Invariants for maintainers

1. **SQLite research state is authoritative and must never be treated as rebuildable cache.**
2. **DuckDB research state is a disposable projection and must be reconstructable from SQLite.**
3. **A projected user mutation and its journal event commit together.**
4. **Desktop stale writes must fail rather than silently overwrite newer user state.**
5. **Editing note prose/labels must not rebind its evidence anchor.**
6. **Opening a research anchor must verify its stored generation or fail closed; it must not substitute current evidence.**
7. **Reviewing a re-anchor candidate must not mutate authoritative research state.**
8. **A confirmed re-anchor must preserve the superseded anchor before replacing the current pointer.**
9. **Re-anchor confirmation is bound to both note version and reviewed canonical generation.**
10. **Re-anchoring cannot cross document or recorded-source identity.**
11. **The DuckDB watermark advances atomically with projected rows.**
12. **Projection replay is idempotent.**
13. **Research joins include canonical generation identity, not segment ID alone.**
14. **Empty research scope means no matches, not unrestricted search.**
15. **Research constraints are applied before ranking/scoring when they are filters.**
16. **Presentation hydrates authoritative note content from SQLite.**
17. **Saved searches persist typed intent, not derived result scope.**
18. **Saved-search rename must preserve typed intent unless an explicit intent-edit operation exists.**
19. **Desktop presentation receives narrow DTOs, not raw database/filesystem authority.**
20. **Operational logging must not copy human research prose or query content into a second archive.**
21. **Deleting any DuckDB file must never delete unique user-authored knowledge.**

If a refactor makes one of those statements false, it changes Scholion's custody model.
