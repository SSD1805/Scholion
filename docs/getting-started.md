# Getting started with Scholion 💃

This is the **use-the-thing** guide.

Scholion is a private, local-first workspace for recorded evidence. You do not need to understand CUDA, DuckDB, SQLite, model revisions, or desktop IPC to use it. Python owns those application/evidence decisions so the desktop can speak in recordings, transcripts, speakers, searches, notes, playback, and evidence.

Scholion is still pre-production. There is no polished signed installer yet, so the supported path is a source/developer checkout.

## Pick the smallest setup

| Goal | First command after cloning | You do not need yet |
|---|---|---|
| inspect/click the frontend with fake local data | `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev:mock` | Python backend, Rust, FFmpeg, model |
| run the native desktop window | bootstrap the repository Python environment, then follow desktop prerequisites and run `npm run tauri dev` | transcription model until processing media |
| use the Python CLI / process recordings | `python3.12 scripts/bootstrap_python.py` | frontend tooling unless you want the GUI |

The repository bootstrap installs Scholion's pinned `uv` into `.tools/uv` and uses it to create/synchronize `.venv`. A system-wide `uv` installation is not required. See **[Project-local developer toolchain](development/project-local-toolchain.md)** for Linux/macOS, Windows, stale-environment recovery, and why `.tools/uv` deliberately lives outside `.venv`.

If a source build behaves strangely, use **[Desktop source-build troubleshooting](development/troubleshooting.md)**.

## Frontend-only mock path

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSD1805/Scholion.git
cd Scholion/frontend
npm ci
npm run doctor:desktop -- --mode=mock
npm run dev:mock
```

`dev:mock` intentionally uses fake local data. Plain `npm run dev` in a browser shows a development-mode explanation rather than pretending the browser has Tauri/Python filesystem authority.

## Native desktop path

Read **[Desktop development prerequisites](development/desktop-development.md)** before the first native build. On a prepared Linux/macOS machine:

```bash
cd Scholion
python3.12 scripts/bootstrap_python.py
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run doctor:desktop
npm run tauri dev
```

On Windows, use `py -3.12 scripts\bootstrap_python.py`; the project-local toolchain guide includes the PowerShell variants.

The debug Tauri host prefers the repository `.venv` for local backend calls. Normally you should not set `SCHOLION_PYTHON` yourself. If you do need an override, preserve the `.venv` launcher path; do not dereference it with `realpath` or `readlink -f`.

## Help is built into the desktop

You do not need to keep this guide open beside Scholion. The sidebar always offers **How this screen works** for the active workspace and **How Scholion works** for the overall evidence model.

Evidence reader, Playback, Transcript tools, and multi-track preflight also expose local explanation beside unfamiliar controls. These explanations are re-openable where appropriate, work with keyboard/touch, and do not rely on hover. They describe existing backend rules without recreating those rules in React.

See **[In-app guidance](in-app-guidance.md)** for the interaction and architecture contract.

## 1. Add or remember recordings

Use **Add evidence** to select recordings, existing transcript JSON, or folders you want Scholion to remember. Remembered locations are explicit permissions, not media custody.

Recording discovery does not itself hash, probe, copy, or transcribe candidates. Manual processing remains the default unless you explicitly choose a different processing policy.

## 2. Process a recording

Choose **Processing**. The current control loop includes:

- machine/resource readiness;
- managed model state;
- outcome-oriented processing profile;
- backend preflight before execution;
- explicit embedded-audio-track confirmation when a source contains more than one audio stream;
- optional deterministic enhancement;
- optional anonymous diarization;
- derived publication intent;
- supervised local start/cancel;
- durable job progress/state;
- checkpoint resume versus fresh retry; and
- private execution-state discard that does not delete source media, canonical transcript evidence, or research.

Transcription models download only when you choose. After installation they stay on this computer in Scholion's private app storage, so transcription can run offline. Today Scholion records the immutable provider revision it received and revalidates the managed local snapshot before use; the stronger policy-trust layer that checks an approved revision and exact file hashes is tracked under issue #110 and is not yet claimed as complete.

For a normal single-track recording, there is no track choice to make. If preflight finds several embedded audio tracks, Processing Center shows the available tracks and bounded source-declared metadata such as title, language, codec, sample rate, channel count, and container-default status. **Start local transcription** remains disabled until you choose one. Scholion then sends that exact index back to Python and re-runs preflight before enabling Start.

Those labels are clues from the source file, not Scholion recommendations. A container can call something `Lav microphone` or mark it default without proving that the label is correct.

Long transcription is not an hour-long WebView request. Python plans/admisses/executes; Tauri supervises allowlisted child processes; React presents status and user intent.

See **[Processing Center](architecture/processing-center.md)** and **[Audio tracks](audio-tracks.md)**.

## 3. Process from the CLI when useful

Bootstrap once (and again after relevant lockfile changes), then activate the repository environment:

```bash
python3.12 scripts/bootstrap_python.py
source .venv/bin/activate
scholion init
scholion doctor
scholion models recommend
scholion models install small
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --dry-run
scholion transcribe interview.m4a
```

For a file with several embedded audio tracks, bind an exact FFmpeg stream index explicitly:

```bash
scholion transcribe meeting.mkv --audio-stream 3 --dry-run
scholion transcribe meeting.mkv --audio-stream 3
```

An unavailable or non-audio index fails instead of silently falling back. The selected stream is preserved in canonical source provenance and restored on checkpoint resume.

Publication views can be requested with:

```bash
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --export txt --export srt --export vtt
```

Resume a validated interrupted job with:

```bash
scholion transcribe interview.m4a --resume JOB_ID
```

Resume rechecks source identity and current resource admission rather than silently changing the original execution contract.

## 4. Search the Library

```bash
scholion library rebuild
scholion library refresh
scholion library search "housing insecurity"
scholion library find "housing affordability" --context-segments 1
```

In the desktop **Library**, search transcripts, notes, tags, and collections. A transcript result can open either:

- **Open transcript passage** for exact verified context, the source-relative cursor, and verified playback; or
- **Transcript tools** for transcript/speaker management on that exact canonical generation.

## 5. Play the verified source

Open a transcript passage and choose **Prepare playback**.

Scholion does not hand the recording path to React. The request carries only the exact transcript generation and current source-relative cursor. Python re-verifies the canonical bytes, original source fingerprint, duration bounds, and selected audio stream. Rust opens only that approved file and gives the webview an opaque local media session.

After preparation you can use the system audio/video controls or **Play from evidence cursor**. Clicking a timed word moves the same cursor, and preparing/replaying from that cursor uses the verified source-relative coordinate.

Playback is refused when the original recording is missing, its bytes changed, the transcript view is stale, the requested coordinate is invalid, or the source has multiple audio tracks that Scholion cannot yet prove the WebView will select correctly. This playback restriction does **not** prevent multi-track transcription: transcription explicitly extracts the user-selected track, while current WebView playback cannot yet prove its rendered embedded track. A verified source can also be unsupported by the local system decoder; that is reported as a codec/container limitation rather than silently transcoding the evidence.

See **[Verified native playback](native-playback.md)** and **[Audio tracks](audio-tracks.md)**.

## 6. Use transcript and speaker tools

From a transcript result, choose **Transcript tools**. Scholion verifies `(document_id, canonical_sha256)` before returning details or accepting mutations.

The panel can show:

- verified generation identity;
- duration/language/segment/speaker summary;
- whether the source recording is currently available;
- selected audio-stream and processing provenance under **Technical details**;
- anonymous speaker refs with optional human display names;
- a derived speaker transcript with explicit **Speaker**, **Overlap**, **Mixed speakers**, and **Unattributed** states; and
- post-hoc TXT/SRT/WebVTT publication to a native-selected folder.

Speaker names never replace anonymous evidence refs. If you save `Dr. Chen` for `speaker-02`, the desktop keeps `speaker-02` visible.

If the transcript changed since the view was opened, Python refuses the stale operation rather than applying a name or publication request to a newer generation.

See **[Transcript and speaker tools](transcript-tools.md)** and **[Give the anonymous speakers names](speaker-names.md)**.

CLI speaker tools remain available:

```bash
scholion library speakers list JOB_ID
scholion library speakers name JOB_ID speaker-02 "Dr. Chen"
scholion library speakers transcript JOB_ID
```

## 7. Keep durable research

Notes, tags, collections, anchors, and saved searches are authoritative local user state.

```bash
scholion library notes add JOB_ID segment-000042 \
  --body "Compare this with the 2024 survey." \
  --tag methodology \
  --collection "Chapter 3"
```

The desktop Research search uses one **Match** choice: Any of these words, All of these words, or Exact phrase. Retrieval, ordering, transcript/speaker/language constraints, research filters, result count, and context live under **Search options**. Technical retrieval provenance stays under **Technical details**.

Research can reopen the exact older canonical generation cited by a durable note. Playback uses that opened generation identity rather than silently substituting the current transcript.

See **[Research search](research-search.md)** and **[Research notes](research-notes.md)**.

## 8. Review storage and retention deliberately

Choose **Storage** to inspect backend-planned custody changes before anything destructive occurs. The desktop can preview exact requested/effective scopes, concrete actions, preserved-note and affected-saved-search counts, and plan-bound confirmation. Source recording deletion requires its own scope and a second acknowledgment before the backend provenance guard can be submitted.

Retention is narrower. It previews old private processing workspaces, excludes running jobs, and visibly marks failed/interrupted candidates whose resume capability would be lost. It does not age-delete canonical transcripts, source recordings, published transcripts, human research, or lightweight lifecycle manifests.

See **[Storage and lifecycle controls](storage-lifecycle.md)**.

## 9. Change the appearance

The header has one **Theme** dropdown with:

- Archive;
- Midnight;
- Paper;
- Moss;
- Plum;
- Ember;
- Pride; and
- Monochrome.

The choice is local presentation preference only. All eight skins use the same semantic tokens for text, surfaces, controls, focus, errors, selection, and accent foreground. Pride's rainbow is decorative; Monochrome is deliberately grayscale. Every registered skin runs through the same contrast/axe qualification.

See **[Desktop themes and accessibility](development/desktop-accessibility.md)**.

## 10. Know the trust boundary

The desktop WebView does not receive arbitrary SQL, shell, subprocess, database, or raw canonical/source filesystem authority.

Ordinary bounded desktop calls share one fixed-command protocol helper and one capability-blind Python host transport. Transcript tools and lifecycle still use separate fixed Tauri commands/Python modules, and playback is narrower still: its path-bearing Python grant is private to Rust, which opens the file and returns only an opaque session to React. Python remains application/evidence authority.

Long-running Processing tasks are intentionally separate from bounded request/response IPC. Tauri owns their supervised child-process lifetime, task identity, status, and cancellation; Python remains job/checkpoint/transcription authority.

Multi-track preflight follows the same rule. Python discovers streams and decides whether explicit confirmation is required. React only presents bounded track metadata and submits the user's chosen index; it does not infer the best track or inspect media itself.

The in-app help layer is static local presentation copy. It has no extra filesystem, process, database, model, media, or network capability.

A future **Check for updates** action is intentionally manual by default. Its design permits only a small signed release-metadata request and forbids sending recordings, transcripts, research state, hardware inventory, model inventory, behavioral telemetry, or an installation ID. Like any network request, the hosting/CDN layer can still observe ordinary connection metadata such as IP address and request time. Existing local work must continue to function when update checking is disabled, offline, or unavailable.

See **[frontend/SECURITY.md](../frontend/SECURITY.md)**, **[Signed update and model trust channel](security/update-model-trust.md)**, and the completed **[architecture/redundancy audit](architecture/redundancy-audit.md)**.

## 11. Optional semantic/hybrid search

Lexical search is the dependency-light default. Semantic search helps when you remember the idea but not the wording; hybrid retrieval combines lexical/semantic ranking using reciprocal rank fusion.

The semantic foundation remains advanced source-build setup until packaged dependency/model custody is qualified.

See **[Semantic search](semantic-search.md)**.

## What Scholion stores

Original media and canonical JSON are evidence. Notes/tags/collections, saved searches, and speaker names are durable human knowledge. Search/research projections and TXT/SRT/WebVTT are derived/rebuildable. Remembered locations and theme selection are machine-local preferences with different custody semantics from evidence. Playback sessions are temporary native capabilities and are not evidence or durable state.

## What comes next?

Research/search, Processing, desktop comprehension/themes, transcript/speaker tools, explicit embedded-track transcription, verified native playback, contextual guidance, lifecycle/retention Storage, architecture/redundancy consolidation, and the Scholion product-identity migration are complete first-release foundation. Next:

1. finish the signed-update and policy-trusted-model integration tracked by #110, then package first-run/update/uninstall behavior; public Linux packaging remains blocked by #135 until the supported Tauri stack leaves the affected GTK3/GLib graph;
2. backup/restore and research portability;
3. packaged semantic custody; and
4. representative-device qualification, including the remaining native task-transport evidence tracked by #114.
