# Scholion documentation voice 🦝🧜‍♀️✨

Scholion documentation should be **rigorous enough to maintain and pleasant enough to
finish reading**.

The project deals with privacy, provenance, media pipelines, model custody, recovery,
search, research state, and security. Those subjects deserve precision. They do not
require the prose to sound like drywall.

This guide exists so future documentation changes preserve one recognizable voice and
visual language without turning every page into a novelty README.

## The governing rule

**Personality may decorate or clarify a contract. It may not replace one.**

If a sentence controls deletion, privacy, security, provenance, compatibility, recovery,
or failure behavior, state the exact rule plainly. A joke can follow it. The joke may not
be the only way to discover what the software does.

Good:

> DuckDB research projections are rebuildable derived state. Deleting them must not
> delete authoritative SQLite notes.
>
> The raccoon may rebuild the index. The raccoon may not eat your notes.

Bad:

> 🦝 Don't worry babe, the vibes are immutable.

That is charming and operationally useless.

## Current truth versus historical evidence

Current-facing documentation must describe what the repository does **now**. When a
feature moves from roadmap to implementation, update the README, roadmap, documentation
index, and directly affected architecture/user guides in the same development sequence.
Do not leave implemented desktop/search/research work described as a “future GUI.”

Dated audit records, security reviews, incident notes, and PR-specific test reports are
historical evidence. Do not rewrite them merely because the present-day product moved on.
If a current landing page cites an old test count as though it were today's state, remove
or reframe that count instead of continually chasing a vanity number.

## Three registers

### 💃 1. Human-facing guides: high personality

Examples include `docs/README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`,
`docs/semantic-search.md`, `docs/research-notes.md`, and feature guides for speakers,
time, recovery, and privacy.

These documents should:

- begin with what the user is trying to accomplish;
- explain unfamiliar terms before using them as shorthand;
- use examples drawn from recordings, interviews, meetings, lectures, and research;
- use occasional playful headings or visual punctuation;
- prefer diagrams over long prose when the idea is structural; and
- tell the reader *why* Scholion behaves a certain way, not merely which command exists.

The user should not have to know what CTranslate2, BM25, RRF, a vector dimension, a
projection watermark, or a cgroup is unless they deliberately open the maintenance hatch.

### 🧜‍♀️ 2. Architecture and development docs: medium personality

These documents are for maintainers and technically curious readers.

They may use exact terms such as `FLOAT[]`, `SearchResponse`, `EvidenceAnchor`, SQLite
WAL, cgroup limits, immutable revisions, or reciprocal-rank fusion. They should still
provide:

1. a plain-English doorway;
2. a visual model where one helps;
3. the exact contract;
4. failure and ownership semantics; and
5. links to adjacent boundaries.

A good architecture page should let a new contributor understand *why the boundary
exists* before reading every implementation detail.

### 🔐 3. Security, audit, schemas, and command contracts: low personality

Security claims must remain auditable and literal.

Light warmth or a memorable heading is fine. Decorative language must never obscure:

- what is protected;
- what is not protected;
- what is local;
- what may use the network;
- what fails closed;
- which threat actors remain out of scope; or
- which advisory or dependency gate is active.

Dated audit records are archival evidence. Do not retroactively rewrite them merely to
match the current voice or product roadmap.

## Recurring visual language

Use motifs sparingly enough that they stay useful.

- **🦝 Raccoon**: rebuildable machinery, caches, indexes, or a memorable explanation of
  what can safely be regenerated.
- **💃 Dancing woman**: orchestration or a celebratory transition after a workflow.
- **🧜‍♀️ Mermaid**: occasional decorative interruption, especially around diagrams or deep
  technical water. It does not represent a service.
- **✨ Sparkles**: optional/enhanced capability or conceptual payoff.
- **🔐 Lock**: actual privacy/security boundary, not generic decoration.

Do not put emoji into every diagram node simply because Mermaid and mermaid sound alike.
The diagram should communicate structure first.

## Mermaid diagrams: source-controlled, generated, and legible

Mermaid is Scholion's **diagram source language**, not a runtime dependency of the
reader's GitHub page.

GitHub can render inline Mermaid itself, but that path depends on GitHub's embedded
renderer and browser/network behavior outside this repository's control. Scholion instead
keeps Mermaid definitions as canonical `.mmd` source and renders ordinary SVG files with
the pinned official `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` toolchain. Markdown displays the generated
SVG and links the editable Mermaid source immediately underneath it.

The ownership model is therefore explicit:

- `docs/diagrams/src/**/*.mmd` is the human-edited diagram source;
- `docs/diagrams/generated/**/*.svg` is rebuildable generated documentation;
- `docs/diagrams/manifest.json` binds each source, generated SVG, owning document, and
  accessible image description;
- `tools/mermaid/mermaid.config.json` freezes renderer behavior such as deterministic IDs,
  font family, security level, and flowchart label mode; and
- `tools/mermaid/package-lock.json` freezes the Mermaid CLI, Puppeteer, browser, and
  transitive documentation-tool dependency graph.

Do **not** hand-edit generated SVG. Do not add an inline `````mermaid`` fence as a second
rendering path. Do not create a JPEG/PNG screenshot of a diagram when SVG can represent it
natively. Change the `.mmd` source, regenerate, inspect the result, and commit source and
SVG together.

For a normal edit:

```bash
npm ci --prefix tools/mermaid
npm --prefix tools/mermaid run render
```

The first command installs only the isolated documentation renderer. The second rewrites
the generated SVG set from the manifest. To verify without modifying committed assets:

```bash
npm --prefix tools/mermaid run check
```

`check` renders every source into a temporary directory and byte-compares it with the
checked-in SVG. CI runs the same operation. A pull request cannot pass the Mermaid docs
gate with a stale, missing, hand-edited, unregistered, or differently rendered SVG.
Inline Mermaid fences are also rejected so GitHub's renderer cannot silently become a
second source of visual truth.

When adding a new diagram, add its `.mmd` file and manifest entry, embed the manifest's SVG
path in the owning Markdown document, add the adjacent **Diagram source (Mermaid)** link,
and run `npm --prefix tools/mermaid run render`. Keep the important relationship in the
node/edge text rather than styling alone, and keep nearby prose sufficient to understand
the architectural point if images are unavailable.

The August 2026 diagram regressions are useful history. A one-shot normalizer once stripped
`classDef` and class assignments from styled diagrams. A later fallback approach used
hand-written SVGs and created another independently maintained representation. The current
contract removes both failure modes: **Mermaid source is authoritative; official Mermaid
output is generated; CI proves the two still agree.**

Use simple `graph LR` / `graph TD` or `flowchart LR` / `flowchart TD` syntax where it fits.
Quote node labels when Mermaid grammar requires it. Avoid HTML labels, embedded markup,
renderer directives, and `linkStyle` tricks unless the pinned renderer has been
deliberately qualified. `graph` and `flowchart` are both valid; do not mechanically rewrite
one spelling into the other.

Color is **not** forbidden. It is part of Scholion's documentation language. It simply may
not be the only carrier of meaning.

### Documentation Mermaid palette

Use these class styles rather than inventing one-off colors:

| Role | Fill | Stroke | Text |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inspection / information | `#D8EEFF` | `#2E617B` | `#12222A` |
| Process / decision | `#E8D9FF` | `#68469B` | `#1F1630` |
| Success / derived view | `#DDF5E3` | `#347A46` | `#142719` |
| Evidence / attention | `#FFF0B8` | `#8A6B18` | `#2C260F` |
| Source / human-authored | `#F9D5E5` | `#7B2E52` | `#22151B` |
| Refusal / destructive state | `#FFD6D6` | `#9E3434` | `#351616` |

These are complementary to the desktop Archive vocabulary of warm parchment, charcoal,
muted teal, brass, and burgundy. Documentation diagrams can be more chromatic because they
need to distinguish architectural roles at a glance.

Styled example:

![Documentation Mermaid palette diagram](./diagrams/generated/documentation-mermaid-palette.svg)

[Diagram source (Mermaid)](./diagrams/src/documentation-mermaid-palette.mmd)

The labels remain meaningful without color. Color makes the structure faster to read.

## Jargon has to earn rent

Write the ordinary-language concept first, then name the technical mechanism.

Instead of:

> `DuckDbSemanticIndex` stores vectors as `FLOAT[]` rather than BLOBs.

Prefer:

> Scholion keeps semantic vectors as numeric data that the search backend can inspect
> directly. In the current DuckDB adapter, those vectors are stored as `FLOAT[]` rather
> than opaque BLOBs.

Nothing became less precise. The reader simply got a staircase instead of a trapdoor.

## Explain the benefit before the mechanism

For user-facing docs, prefer this order:

1. **What problem does this solve?**
2. **What does the user experience?**
3. **What stays private / authoritative?**
4. **How do I use it?**
5. **How does it work?**
6. **What are the current limits?**
7. **Where is the deep architecture reference?**

Architecture docs can invert steps 4 and 5, but should still start with purpose.

## Humor should help memory

A joke earns its place when it makes a distinction memorable, relieves a dense transition,
gives a difficult concept a concrete mental model, or makes the reader want to continue.

It does not earn its place when it makes an error ambiguous, trivializes a security or
privacy failure, appears in every paragraph, relies on an in-group reference to understand
the technical point, or sounds like a corporate account impersonating a person.

Camp needs negative space.

## Searchability still matters

Playful headings should retain descriptive nouns whenever possible.

Good:

- `## 🦝 What lives under the floorboards? Rebuildable search state`
- `## 💃 Bringing the ranks together: hybrid retrieval`
- `## 🔐 Privacy boundary`

Less useful:

- `## She has arrived`
- `## The girls are fighting`

The latter may be funny in prose. They are poor anchors for someone searching a repo.

## Accessibility

- Emoji supplements text; it does not replace meaning.
- Diagrams receive meaningful Markdown alt text and surrounding prose.
- Every displayed generated SVG has an adjacent link to copyable Mermaid source.
- Color is never the only carrier of state.
- Commands and identifiers remain copyable and exact.
- Avoid joke-heavy error examples that obscure the real failure message.
- Prefer headings that remain meaningful to screen-reader and search users.
- Desktop UI work should keep keyboard reachability, visible focus, reduced motion, and
  automated axe checks in the same tranche that introduces the interaction.

## The desired reader experience

A reader should be able to enter Scholion knowing almost nothing about local ML and leave
understanding:

- what the application does;
- what happens to their recording;
- which artifacts are authoritative;
- what can safely be rebuilt;
- what research state survives those rebuilds;
- what stays local;
- how to resume, search, annotate, and navigate work; and
- where to go when they want the exact engineering contract.

If they accidentally learn a little systems architecture while a scholarly raccoon points
at a provenance table, that is considered a feature.
